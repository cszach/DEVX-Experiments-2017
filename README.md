# DEVX-Experiments-2017

[Pierfrancesco Soffritti][pier]'s WebGL experiment made for DEVX Experiments 2017.
In this fork, the JavaScript code is linted according to Mr. Doob's coding
style:tm: so that I can read and learn from the source code easier.

Does the code still work after being linted? [Seems like it still does][web].

My favorite WebGL experiment by the way.
